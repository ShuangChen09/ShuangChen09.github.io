## About Me

I am currently a senior student majoring in Statistics at <a href="http://jwsy.jsnu.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> CW CHU College (Talent Development Base)</a> and <a href="http://maths.jsnu.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> School of Mathematics and Statistics</a> , Jiangsu Normal University. During my undergraduate studies, I earned a weighted average score of 91.3 in mathematics and statistics courses. My overall weighted GPA was 90.4, ranking me third out of 51 students in the statistics department.

Under the guidance of Professor <a href="http://maths.jsnu.edu.cn/_t1395/17335/list.htm" target="_blank"> Lianyong Qian</a>, I have had the privilege of conducting research on integer-valued time series. I have a strong interest in various statistical models and their applications. In the past, I have also explored areas such as Bayesian inference, machine learning, variable selection, medical image recognition, and structural equation modeling.

During my time in college, I actively participated in statistical modeling competitions and Kaggle challenges, which exposed me to a diverse range of statistical models. These experiences not only honed my problem-solving skills but also cultivated my programming abilities. Furthermore, in the summer of 2022, during my internship with the municipal government, I utilized machine learning techniques(XGBoost, LSTM) to address specific issues related to public welfare. Through these endeavors, I discovered the captivating power of statistical methods and developed a profound belief that statistics, as a discipline rooted in data, holds the potential to create substantial value for society.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I have a passion for long-distance swimming and running. Occasionally, I also enjoy playing the flute. Furthermore, my interest in solving Rubik's Cubes began when I was eight years old, and I have even participated in world-class Rubik's Cube competitions. During my college years, I held the position of vice president in the university's Rubik's Cube club.
